# VirtualTourist
Virtual Tourist is an iOS application that allows users to visit virtual locations by adding pins to a MapView. Once a user taps a pin the app fetches photos from Flickr for that location. Also, the user can remove all pins from MapView by clicking on the edit button then delete pins.
